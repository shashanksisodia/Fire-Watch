# Fire-Watch
Network Load Balancer


High bandwidth tasks creates a lot of disruptions for other nodes on the Network. However network traffic keeps on fluctuating, and there's a lot of time intervals or gaps in it. 
So over a continued period of time we get lots of quanta that can be optimally used to run these high bandwidth tasks.

That's what FireWatch is all about. It monitors the network usage with profiling based on IP's and intelligently switches the tasks through a given machine.
